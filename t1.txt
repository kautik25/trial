A number of Pokémon games have been released, mostly on Nintendo systems, with the exception of Pokémon GO as The Pokémon Company is owned by Nintendo.

Most games are based on catching, training and battling Pokémon, and the player is a Pokémon trainer who does all these things. There are a number of aspects to the games.

In the games, Pokémon are creatures that trainers catch (using various types of capture devices known as Poké Balls), train, battle, collect, and trade with each other. As of the seventh generation, there are 802 of them. One of the most popular Pokémon in competitive battling is Mega Kangaskhan, because of its ability to hit the target twice with each move.

Another Pokémon game is the famous Pokémon GO that can be played only on touch phones. It has a big difference from the other games but its basics are the same. This game uses Augmented Reality and the phone's GPS to give the player a very real sense of play. People literally walk around their neighborhoods, explore new places and catch Pokémon which can be captured along with your surrounding environment by using the phone's camera. People can also go to special places or landmarks where there would be Poké Stops and Gyms which can be used to collect items, battle other Pokémon etc. This game has been a huge success when it was released and is widely considered as the beginning of the AR era.
